server:
- sponge should not work against lava (supersponge does!)
- only send player position updates if a player's position has changed
- persist level properties (and allow admins to change them):
   - server name
   - server size (width/height/depth)
   - server description
   - player spawn point

protocol:
- make client understand when it gets admin powers (so adminium can be deleted)
